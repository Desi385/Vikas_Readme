### About

🔭 I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I have previously worked in the fields of Computer Architecture, Signal and Image Processing, Biometrics and Pattern Recognition. 

💬 My personal mission is to build AI-based solutions that solve a high-impact problem for people around the globe and simplify everyday living.

👯 I'm interested in mentoring, coaching and collaborating with fellow enthusiasts in the field of AI. If you have an idea related to my areas of interest, feel free to shoot me an [email](hi@aman.ai)! 

### Bio

👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Senior Engineer on the [Machine Intelligence and Neural Design (MIND)](https://www.apple.com/careers/us/machine-learning-and-ai.html) team at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), where I specialize in designing AI models for a wide range of applications including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. Previously, I worked on architecting the performance of Apple's Mac lineup, developing models for estimating performance of future Macs years in advance, and driving debugs in the HW/SW stack to narrow down and fix performance bottlenecks.

🌱 I'm currently pursuing my graduate studies part-time in [Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) with a specialization in [Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.stanford.edu/) from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). 

🎓 I received my Masters in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.wisc.edu/) with a specialization in [Computer Architecture](http://rsrch.cs.wisc.edu/arch/uwarch/?q=node/69) from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) and graduated in 2014 with an outstanding graduate student award.
