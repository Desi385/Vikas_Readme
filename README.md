### Bio

👨🏻‍💻 I lead a team of scientists at [Amazon Alexa AI](https://amazon.science) to find innovative ways to advance the field of Speaker Understanding, Recognition and Personalization. Previously, I was part of the [Machine Intelligence Neural Design (MIND)](https://www.apple.com/careers/us/machine-learning-and-ai.html) team at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), where I specialize in designing AI models for a wide range of applications including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. Prior to that, I worked on architecting the performance of Apple's Mac lineup, developing models for estimating performance of future Macs years in advance, and driving debugs to narrow down and fix performance bottlenecks.

🌱 I'm currently pursuing my graduate studies part-time in [Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) with a specialization in [Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.stanford.edu/) from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). 

🎓 I received my Masters in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.wisc.edu/) with a specialization in [Computer Architecture](http://rsrch.cs.wisc.edu/arch/uwarch/?q=node/69) from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) and graduated in 2014 with an outstanding graduate student award.
